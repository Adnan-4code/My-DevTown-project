This project is built and developed in Google Colab, where different coding tasks and problem-solving approaches were implemented, corrected, and optimized step by step. It focuses on applying concepts from algorithms, data structures, and machine learning, while also experimenting with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, and PyTorch/TensorFlow depending on the task. The goal of the project is to serve as a learning and practice environment, documenting the process of writing, testing, and refining code, while keeping everything organized and version-controlled through GitHub for future scalability and reuse.
